# Discord Bot: A Universal Assistant for Learning, Task Management, and Collaboration

This project is a multifunctional Discord bot that combines learning, task management, collaboration, and entertainment features. The bot is developed in Golang and uses modern technologies to ensure high performance and scalability.

## Main modules

The bot is divided into several modules, each of which is responsible for a specific functionality:

### 1. Learning
- **Tasks and challenges**: The bot offers tasks to solve (like on Codewars) and challenges.
- **Quizzes**: Conducting quizzes on various topics.
- **User progress**: Tracking progress (number of solved tasks, completed quizzes).

### 2. Task Management
- **Creating and distributing tasks**: Users can create tasks and assign them to other participants.
- **Integrating with external services**: Connecting to Trello, Notion, and other services to synchronize tasks.

### 3. Collaboration
- **Collaborative projects**: Creating projects and inviting participants.
- **Task discussion**: Ability to discuss tasks in separate channels or threads.
- **Ratings and motivation**: Displaying the rating of participants by activity.

### 4. Custom commands
- **Creating and managing teams**: Users can create their own teams for quick access to frequently used functions.

### 5. Entertainment
- **Idea generation**: The bot suggests ideas for projects or challenges.
- **Mini-games**: For example, "rock-paper-scissors" or quizzes.

### 6. Administration
- **Bot settings management**: Setting up bot parameters for the server.
- **Logging and monitoring**: Tracking activity and errors.

## Project architecture

### Main components
1. **Bot core**:
- Connecting to Discord.
- Processing commands.
- Logging and monitoring.

2. **Modules**:
- Each module (training, tasks, collaboration, etc.) is a separate package in the project.
- Modules interact with the core and with each other through clearly defined interfaces.

3. **Database**:
- Storing user data, tasks, progress, etc.
- Each module has access to its own part of the database.

4. **API**:
- External APIs (Trello, Notion, OpenWeatherMap, etc.) are connected via separate packages.
